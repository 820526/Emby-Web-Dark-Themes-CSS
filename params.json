As long as we can't install themes as plugins like Emby Theater, I can't guarantee perfection with future updates, sorry for the inconvenience.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it!\r\n\r\n######_**Ben Z**_\r\n\r\n##Credits\r\n####[Shaefurr's Disparity Icons](http://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/7413-shaefurrs-disparity-icons/)\r\n",
