###**The web app is getting older and start being retro-fitted to adopt the newer techniques of Emby Theater.** 
It means there are more fixes needed on every update. As long as we can't install themes as plugins like Emby Theater, I can't guarantee perfection with future updates, sorry for the inconvenience.

I hope you like it!
