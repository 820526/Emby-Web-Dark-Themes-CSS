##Note

Feel free to download the CSS files on GitHub but you won't get auto updates this way. You can also get the _**Logos & Icons Pack**_ [**HERE**](https://github.com/BenZuser/Emby-Dark-Themes-Resources/tree/master/images/logos-and-icons) if you want them locally, but you don't have to.

###**The web app is getting older and start being retro-fitted to adopt the newer techniques of Emby Theater.** 
It means there are more fixes needed on every update. As long as we can't install themes as plugins like Emby Theater, I can't guarantee perfection with future updates, sorry for the inconvenience.

I hope you like it!
